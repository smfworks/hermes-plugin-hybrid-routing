# Hybrid Contextual Model Routing: From Skill to Hermes Plugin

*The routing stack we built last week is now a published Hermes plugin. Here's what changed, how to install it, and why we're shipping blank configs instead of defaults.*

---

## The Journey

Last week we published [Building a Hybrid Contextual Model Routing Stack for Hermes Agent](/blog/2026-07-28-hybrid-contextual-model-routing-hermes) — the story of building a three-signal classification engine that routes tasks to the right model without breaking prompt caching. That post covered the architecture, the honest provider discovery process, and the path to a plugin.

The path is now a road. The plugin is live.

**Repository:** [smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing](https://github.com/smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing)

## What Changed: Skill to Plugin

The routing stack started as a profile-local skill — Python files in Aiona's Hermes profile directory, usable only by our agents. It worked, but it was locked to our setup. Other Hermes users could not install it without manually copying files and adjusting paths.

The plugin changes three things:

### 1. Three LLM-Callable Tools

The agent can now call routing directly as a tool, alongside its other tools:

- `route_classify(text)` — classify a task and get a routing recommendation
- `route_status()` — show the current routing configuration
- `route_test()` — run the 9-case test suite

The agent does not need to load a skill or run a terminal command. It calls the tool the same way it calls `web_search` or `read_file`. The routing decision comes back as structured JSON.

### 2. Native Slash Command

The `/route` slash command works in the CLI and on every gateway platform — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, all of them. This was impossible as a skill. As a plugin, it is a single registration call:

```python
ctx.register_command(
    name="route",
    handler=handle_route_command,
    description="Model routing: /route [status|test|<text>]",
)
```

Usage:
```
/route                              — show routing config
/route test                         — run test suite
/route Analyze this architecture    — classify text
```

### 3. CLI Subcommand

Terminal users get `hermes route`:

```bash
hermes route                         — show config
hermes route test                    — run tests
hermes route "Debug this function"   — classify text
```

## The Design Decision: Blank by Default

The first version of the plugin shipped with default model refs — `ollama-cloud/glm-5.2` for the fast tier, `ollama-cloud/mistral-large-3:675b` for the strong tier, and so on. The defaults assumed the user had an Ollama Cloud API key.

That was wrong. Not everyone has Ollama Cloud. A user with only OpenAI and Anthropic configured would install the plugin and silently route everything to a provider they could not call. The router would return model refs that fail on first use.

The fix: **all model fields ship blank.** The user must explicitly configure their models on install.

When the router detects no models configured, it returns a clear message:

```
No models configured. Run 'hermes route' to set up your routing config,
or copy the default config to ~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/hybrid_routing/
routing_config.yaml and fill in your model refs.
```

The shipped config still includes the difficulty heuristics, sensitivity regex patterns, and role cue keywords — those work out of the box because they are not provider-specific. Only the model refs require explicit configuration.

This is the right install experience. A user who installs the plugin should immediately see "you need to configure your models" rather than silently routing to a provider they do not have.

## Installation

### Option A: From Hermes CLI

```bash
hermes plugins install smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing
```

Hermes asks whether to enable the plugin on install. Say yes:

```bash
hermes plugins enable hybrid-contextual-routing
```

### Option B: Via pip

```bash
pip install hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing
```

Then enable in Hermes:

```bash
hermes plugins enable hybrid-contextual-routing
```

### Option C: Manual clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing.git \
  ~/.hermes/plugins/hybrid-contextual-routing
hermes plugins enable hybrid-contextual-routing
```

## Configuration

After install, copy the default config and fill in your models:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/profiles/<your-profile>/hybrid_routing/
cp ~/.hermes/plugins/hybrid-contextual-routing/data/routing_config.yaml \
   ~/.hermes/profiles/<your-profile>/hybrid_routing/routing_config.yaml
```

Run `hermes auth list` to see which providers you have, then edit the config:

```yaml
tiers:
  fast:
    model: ollama-cloud/glm-5.2
  balanced:
    model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol
  strong:
    model: xai-oauth/grok-4.5

sensitivity:
  local_only_model: ollama-cloud/qwen3.5:397b

delegation:
  primary_model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol
```

Leave any tier or role blank if you do not have a model for it. The router skips blank entries and falls through to the next available one.

Verify:

```bash
hermes route          # should show your models
hermes route test     # should pass 9/9
hermes route "test"   # should classify and show a routing decision
```

## Cloud/Local Hybrid Inference

The plugin supports hybrid stacks with local and cloud providers. Our SMF Works stack runs four providers:

```yaml
tiers:
  fast:
    model: custom:local-laguna/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4   # DGX Spark, local, unlimited
  balanced:
    model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol                           # cloud
  strong:
    model: xai-oauth/grok-4.5                                 # cloud

roles:
  creative:
    model: ollama-cloud/glm-5.2                               # cloud, inexpensive

sensitivity:
  local_only_model: custom:local-laguna/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4  # sensitive stays local
```

This gives you:
- **Fast tasks** → local model, zero marginal cost
- **Balanced work** → cloud model, per-token
- **Deep reasoning** → cloud frontier model, per-token
- **Creative writing** → cloud model optimized for content
- **Sensitive content** → local model, data never leaves your hardware

## Plugin Structure

```
hybrid_contextual_routing/
├── plugin.yaml              # manifest — declares tools, commands, skill
├── __init__.py              # registration — wires everything into Hermes
├── router.py                # classification engine (profile-agnostic)
├── data/
│   └── routing_config.yaml  # default config (blank models, shipped)
├── skill/
│   └── SKILL.md             # bundled skill (agent guidance)
└── README.md                # installation and usage docs
```

The classification engine is profile-agnostic. The config is profile-specific. Any Hermes user can install the plugin, configure their models, and get contextual routing — regardless of which providers they use.

## What the Plugin Does Not Do

The router is advisory, not automatic. It does not hook into every turn and force model switches. The agent calls `route_classify` when it wants a routing recommendation, then decides whether to delegate based on the result.

This is deliberate. Automatic hooks would inject into every turn and break prompt caching — the exact thing we built the delegation-based approach to avoid. The router respects the architecture. It gives the agent information. The agent makes the decision.

## Why a Standalone Plugin, Not Core

Hermes' AGENTS.md is explicit about extension priorities:

> *Prefer, in order: extend existing code → CLI command + skill → service-gated tool → plugin → MCP server → new core tool (last resort).*

A plugin is the right layer for model routing. Not every Hermes user needs it — some run a single model and are happy. Routing assumes you have multiple providers, care about cost optimization, and want delegation-based switching. That is an opinionated feature, not universal infrastructure.

A standalone plugin repo lets us iterate at our own speed. Community feedback drives the roadmap. If the Nous Research maintainers decide it belongs in core, we will submit with a track record. If it stays standalone, that is where it belongs.

## Call for Feedback

We are shipping this as a beta and asking for community input before considering a core submission. Specifically, we want to know:

1. **Does the classification logic work for your tasks?** The heuristics — hard cues, simple cues, role keywords — are tuned for our workload. Yours may differ. Tell us what gets misclassified.

2. **Does the blank-by-default install experience work?** Is the configuration process clear, or do you need more guidance?

3. **What roles are missing?** We ship coding, research, creative, strategy, and vision. Legal, medical, education, and other verticals might need their own role definitions with specialized cue keywords.

4. **Does the delegation pattern work in practice?** The router recommends delegation when the selected model differs from the primary. Does that produce good outcomes, or does the delegation overhead outweigh the benefit?

5. **What about cron jobs?** The plugin includes a reference mapping cron jobs to routing tiers, but does not automatically configure cron models. Should it?

File issues on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing) or reach out in the Nous Research Discord `#plugins-skills-and-skins` channel.

## The Roadmap

**Now:** Plugin published, community feedback open.

**Phase 1 (next 2-3 weeks):** Gather feedback, fix issues, iterate on the repo. Tune heuristics based on real usage patterns. Add roles based on community requests.

**Phase 2:** Evaluate whether the classification heuristics should be configurable per-profile or per-organization. Consider a learned router that adapts based on delegation outcomes — the Praxis framework already has a `PredictiveRouter` that learns from task history.

**Phase 3:** Evaluate core submission based on community adoption and Nous maintainer interest. If the plugin gets traction and the maintainers want it in core, we submit with a proven track record.

## Try It

```bash
hermes plugins install smfworks/hermes-plugin-hybrid-routing
hermes plugins enable hybrid-contextual-routing
hermes route test
```

Nine test cases should pass. Then configure your models and start routing.
